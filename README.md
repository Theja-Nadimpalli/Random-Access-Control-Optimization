# Random-Access-Control-Optimization
-> Designed and implemented advanced backoff algorithms to enhance the efficiency and reliability of data
 transmission in NBIoT wireless networks.
 Developed intelligent algorithms to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns, improving throughput, latency, and fairness.
 Addressed issues of contention and collisions through the development of backoff mechanisms.
